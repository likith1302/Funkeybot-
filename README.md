# Funkeybot-
This Python script creates a surreal-themed chatbot using OpenRouter with an OpenAI wrapper. It sends prompts to GPT-4o with a funky, chaotic personality called FunkyBot. It includes custom headers, basic error handling, and hardcoded API credentials (a security risk). Designed for playful, unpredictable interactionsâ€”not production use.
